Dynamical systems like drones require a designed controller to make them stable. Machine learning can assist in that. mostafa is delighted to have frankon, as he has a domain application through which machine learning can be applied. mostafa values the value of having some end-user to assess the quality of algorithmic techniques deployed. mostafa suggested doing a project related to dynamical systems through purely simulations, Benefiting from forkan\u0026rsquo;s background.    Quotes\n mostafa: Software engineers build what is well-known to be changed in the future, but mathematicians establish ever lasting truths. dharshen k: I think everyone knows india is one of the most competitive contries. the ratio of acceptance in good jobs is low. dharshen k: Studnets usually reveal only 50% of their work. mostafa: I just wanted to justify for everyone that amir is capable of actively contribuiting to the discussion of this group. forkan: Control systems are applicable to any domain, and that is interesting.
